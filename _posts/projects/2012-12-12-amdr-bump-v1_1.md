#amdr.js: bump v1.1

After fixed some small bugs and some improvements,
I decided to add WebWorker support for [amdr.js](http://shenjunru.github.com/amdr).
And that does not required too much changes.
Also I created the test cases for the WebWorker from the old one.
Now I bump the new version 1.1 with the WebWorker support.


## Changelogs:
* Supports WebWorker.
* Fixed `fallback()` for `require()`.

## Todos:
* loads modules in parallel way in the WebWorker.
